## About the Project üìñ  

**Mugged** is a customizable gift shop specializing in personalized mugs and other gift items. This **Progressive Web App (PWA)** was developed as the **final year project** for the **Work Integrated Learning (WIL)** module, a key component of the Diploma in Information Technology in Software Development.  

The **WIL module** is designed to integrate theoretical knowledge with real-world application, emphasizing teamwork, project management, and professional development. The module required us to complete a full software development lifecycle (SDLC), including:  
1. **Project Planning**  
2. **Requirements Analysis**  
3. **System Design**  
4. **Development**  
5. **Testing**  
6. **Deployment**  

This project allowed us to gain hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and methodologies, preparing us for professional roles in software development.  

## Project Overview üíª  

**Mugged PWA** is a dynamic application developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **ASP.NET MVC**. It features a robust backend powered by an **Azure SQL Database** and integrates **Azure DevOps** for efficient project management, testing, and deployment.  

The application enables users to personalize mugs with text and images, browse products in a visually appealing gallery, and complete purchases through a secure and responsive interface.  

Key phases of the project:  
1. **Project Plan**: Defined goals, milestones, and deliverables, including risk management strategies and technical feasibility.  
2. **Requirement Analysis**: Gathered and documented functional and non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and logical system models.  
3. **System Design**: Created database schemas, architectural diagrams, and UI mockups using Figma and Draw.io.  
4. **Development**: Implemented both frontend and backend functionality using Visual Studio 2022, adhering to coding standards and agile practices.  
5. **Testing**: Conducted unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing, leveraging Azure Test Plans and NUnit.  
6. **Deployment**: Set up CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployment and maintenance using Azure Pipelines.

## Features ‚ú®  

- **Customizable Products**: Users can personalize mugs with text and images.

### **Testing**  
- NUnit: Unit testing for backend logic  
- Azure Test Plans: Automated and manual testing  

## Project Lifecycle üîÑ  

### 1. Project Plan  
We began with a comprehensive project plan that defined:  
- Goals and objectives  
- Milestones and deliverables  
- Risk analysis and mitigation strategies  
- Feasibility studies (technical, operational, and economic)  
- Team roles and responsibilities  

The **Gantt charts** and **PERT diagrams** created using MS Project guided our timelines and critical paths.

### 2. Requirements Analysis  
The next phase involved gathering and analyzing the functional and non-functional requirements:  
- **Use Case Diagrams**: Defined system interactions and actors.  
- **Logical System Model**: Outlined inputs, outputs, processes, and relationships.  
- **Functional Specifications**: Documented all system capabilities and constraints.  

### 3. System Design  
The system design phase included:  
- **Database Design**: Normalized schema in 3NF, ensuring referential integrity.  
- **Architectural Design**: High-level and low-level diagrams showcasing the system‚Äôs architecture (three-tier design).  
- **UI/UX Mockups**: Created in Figma for a consistent and user-centric interface.  
- **ERD Diagrams**: Defined entity relationships and data structures.  

### 4. Development  
Development was divided into **frontend** and **backend** components:  
- Frontend: Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** with responsive design principles.  
- Backend: Developed in **ASP.NET MVC** with C# to handle server-side logic and APIs.  

Version control was maintained via **GitHub**, with pull requests and branch protection rules ensuring code quality.

### 5. Testing  
A rigorous testing process ensured the application met all requirements:  
- **Unit Testing**: NUnit for backend methods.  
- **Integration Testing**: Verified API and database interactions.  
- **Manual Testing**: Checked UI responsiveness and user flows.  
- **Automated Testing**: Conducted using Azure Test Plans.  

### 6. Deployment  
The project was deployed using **Azure DevOps**:  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated builds and deployments for consistent updates.  
- **Hosting**: Application hosted on Azure App Service for scalability and reliability.  
- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring to ensure performance and uptime.
