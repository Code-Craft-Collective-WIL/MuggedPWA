## About the Project üìñ  

**Mugged** is a customizable gift shop specializing in personalized mugs and other gift items. This **Progressive Web App (PWA)** was developed as the **final year project** for the **Work Integrated Learning (WIL)** module, a key component of the Diploma in Information Technology in Software Development.  

The **WIL module** is designed to integrate theoretical knowledge with real-world application, emphasizing teamwork, project management, and professional development. The module required us to complete a full software development lifecycle (SDLC), including:  
1. **Project Planning**  
2. **Requirements Analysis**  
3. **System Design**  
4. **Development**  
5. **Testing**  
6. **Deployment**  

This project allowed us to gain hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and methodologies, preparing us for professional roles in software development.

## Project Overview üíª  

**Mugged PWA** is a dynamic application developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **ASP.NET MVC**. It features a robust backend powered by an **Azure SQL Database** and integrates **Azure DevOps** for efficient project management, testing, and deployment.  

The application enables users to personalize mugs with text and images, browse products in a visually appealing gallery, and complete purchases through a secure and responsive interface.  

Key phases of the project:  
1. **Project Plan**: Defined goals, milestones, and deliverables, including risk management strategies and technical feasibility.  
2. **Requirement Analysis**: Gathered and documented functional and non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and logical system models.  
3. **System Design**: Created database schemas, architectural diagrams, and UI mockups using Figma and Draw.io.  
4. **Development**: Implemented both frontend and backend functionality using Visual Studio 2022, adhering to coding standards and agile practices.  
5. **Testing**: Conducted unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing, leveraging Azure Test Plans and NUnit.  
6. **Deployment**: Set up CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployment and maintenance using Azure Pipelines.
